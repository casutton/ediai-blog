This is Markdown, so you can write whatever you want that way.

Right below here, put a bit image from your paper (e.g., your overview figure or something like that)

<img class="wraparound" src="/images/edinburgh_castle.jpg">

(image source: http://photoeverywhere.co.uk/britain/edinburgh/slides/edinburgh_castle.htm)

Keep the image above, and make it a big image from your paper.

The text here should be about what the paper is trying to do here and why it is cool.
Basically it can be what you said in the abstract / introduction of your paper.
But simplify the language a little bit to make it seem more informal.

If you'd like to create a video, that's great! But no obligation. Text is fine.

If you don't want to link to code or a paper, etc, then delete the relevant
link from the YAML preamble at the top of the md file for the post.
